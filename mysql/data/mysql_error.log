\This could be because you hit a bug. It is also possible that this binary
or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built,
or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

wTo report this bug, see https://mariadb.com/kb/en/reporting-bugs

iWe will try our best to scrape up some info that will hopefully help
diagnose the problem, but since we have already crashed, 
something is definitely wrong and this may fail.

Server version: 10.4.27-MariaDB
key_buffer_size=16777216
read_buffer_size=262144
max_used_connections=0
nmax_threads=65537
xthread_count=6
6It is possible that mysqld could use up to 
key_buffer_size + (read_buffer_size + sort_buffer_size)*max_threads = 20302 K  bytes of memory
4Hope that's ok; if not, decrease some variables in the equation.

-packThread pointer: 0x0
aAttempting backtrace. You can use the following information to find out
where mysqld died. If you see no messages after this, something went
terribly wrong...
